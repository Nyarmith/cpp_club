# Accelerated C++ flash cards

This directory contains flash card date exported from Anki using the Crowd
Anki add-on.

To use, first install the add-on as described here:
https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki

Per issue Stvad/CrowdAnki#20, you may need to edit the add-on files after
installation (see the issue for details).

Where applicable, Markdown has been used for formatting the flash cards,
which has then been converted to HTML using the Power Format Pack add-on.
When making changes to flash cards, edit as Markdown then save as formatted
HTML. See the AnkiWeb page for installation details:
